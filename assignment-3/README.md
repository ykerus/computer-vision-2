This folder contains material used for CV2 - assignment3.

First run "pip install -r requirements.txt" (after making a virtual environment). I have added the versions that I used specifically, but these might be old. So if something goes wrong, just try to remove these versions and install the latest versions.

All results can be obtained by navigating to the code folder (i.e. "cd code") and running main.py (i.e. "python main.py").

Results folders will be made automatically including figures. Parameter statistics are printed to the screen. 

Code is split per section in different files with general functions in "utils.py".

As you could guess, the report for this assignment is named "REPORT.pdf".

I hope I am allowed to hand in the BFM models, and that it doesn't count as illegally distributing them. But if that's the case, please don't report me to the police.

To install and put inside "models":
model2017-1_bfm_nomouth.h5
model2017-1_face12_nomouth.h5
