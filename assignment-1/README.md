/////////// M-FILE ///////////////////////////////

- readPcd.m 
This m-file is to read provided pcd files by matlab. This files is provided for windows.
This file requires a minor change for other OS to read point cloud data correctly.
The new line command (for windows) in "line 85" is ['\n'], this should be replaced with ['\r \n'] for other OS.

Please contact TAs if it still doesn't work.

Example usage :
pointCloud = readPcd(pcd_img_path);

Note: a returned pointCloud is a matrix of dimension Nx3, but not 3xN as source.mat and target.mat

Note: The provided point clouds does not only consist of person (it also contains background). Please apply a distance threshold to remove background (e.g. remove points further than 2meters to the camera).
